Given phone digits, print all possible words that can be formed from them.

Before the advent of QWERTY keyboards, texts and numbers were placed on the same key. 
For example, 2 has “ABC” if we wanted to write anything starting with ‘A’ we need to type 
key 2 once. If we wanted to type ‘B’, press key 2 twice and thrice for typing ‘C’.

Example: 

Input number: 234

Output:

adg adh adi aeg aeh aei afg afh 
afi bdg bdh bdi beg beh bei bfg 
bfh bfi cdg cdh cdi ceg ceh cei 
cfg cfh cfi

Explanation: All possible words which can be 
formed are (Alphabetical order):

adg adh adi aeg aeh aei afg afh 
afi bdg bdh bdi beg beh bei bfg 
bfh bfi cdg cdh cdi ceg ceh cei 
cfg cfh cfi

If 2 is pressed then the alphabet
can be a, b, c, 
Similarly, for 3, it can be 
d, e, f, and for 4 can be g, h, i. 

Input number: 5

Output: 
j k l
Explanation: All possible words which can be 
formed are (Alphabetical order):

j, k, l, only these three alphabets 
can be written with j, k, l.

Constraints:

0 <= digits.length <= 4
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].
